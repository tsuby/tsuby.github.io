**What's worth documenting? - Everything!**

That's the question and answer that have led to this post. Because writing makes you deeply question your assumptions, and documenting a process can be highly valuable, there is nothing to lose here.

I am starting to work on a new consumer app that has been fiddling around in my brain for years, but never got around to actually building it.
I've done some groundwork, looking into high-level stuff like what technologies to leverage, but I've realized that going too deep too soon can kill a personal project before it even begins.
Because of this, I've started with some basic decisions:
* I will be using react-native for building the mobile app (no time to learn native iOS _and_ Android).
* I will be using Django for building the backend (Django admin rules)
* fly.io for deployment (but there's such a long road to get there that it may change).
* Firebase auth for MVP

I want any project I do to bring value to at least -a- person, even if that someone is just me.

So here's to you, the builders - may you have fun building cool stuff! Here's to me, cause I really want to build this!

The next post will document how I set up the project and Firebase auth.
