Hello. This is the customary initial 'Hello World' post that I feel is rather necessary for a programmer's blog.

My name is Razvan and I program for a living. I have recently graduated university and I am finding my way through life. This blog was created as part of a framework towards my self-development. At this point, I don't expect anyone except me to ever read these lines, but nonetheless making this whole process public provides a feeling of accountability that I need. Logging events and thoughts and experiences of my life has always been an appealing thing to do for me, but recent developments in my knowledge tree (aka Youtube videos overdose) have pushed me to actually doing it.

I'm using Jekyll and it's run on Github pages. It's a nifty little trick that seemed the perfect solution. I also toyed with the idea of building my own blog from scratch (as the process would have been educational), but that seemed like a lot of overhead and a lot of work I didn't find particularly interesting.

Enough about the medium, let's move on to discuss my own person. I'll start with what feels wrong. The thing that you have to know about me is that I'm a chronic procrastinator. For the past 3 to 5 years I have wallowed in my own procrastination and self pity tar pit because my thought patterns were (and probably still are) highly nihilistic. The lack of purpose in my life as a young adult feels like slowly drowning. Enjoying things becomes harder, playfulness and imagination starts to wane. As you probably know, that is no way to live life in your 20s, the decade of your life that is supposed to be the most exciting. The first step towards getting out of this rut is this post. Hopefully, it will be followed by others.

I will be posting anything that comes to mind: technology, tutorials (which could also be on Youtube), my own fiction and poetry, art (music, film, theatre, books, comics), ideas, politics, whatever. Basically the dump of my everyday thoughts, but focused and way more organized.
